# MENTAL FITNESS TRACKER

## Overview

The **Mental Fitness Tracker** project aims to monitor and analyze changes in mental fitness across different countries using machine learning techniques. This project utilizes two datasets containing information on various mental diseases and their probabilities over a given time span. By applying supervised learning algorithms, the goal is to track and understand changes in mental fitness among populations.

## Datasets

Two datasets are provided for this project:

1. **Dataset 1**: Contains data on various mental diseases across different countries.
   - **Features**: Country, Disease, Probability, Date

2. **Dataset 2**: Provides temporal probability data of different types of mental diseases.
   - **Features**: Country, Disease, Probability, Time Span

## Objectives

- **Data Analysis**: Explore and preprocess the provided datasets.
- **Modeling**: Apply supervised learning algorithms to analyze changes in mental fitness.
- **Prediction**: Predict future trends in mental fitness based on historical data.
- **Visualization**: Create visualizations to represent the changes and insights derived from the data.

## Supervised Learning Algorithms

The project employs various supervised learning algorithms to achieve the following:

- **Classification**: To classify mental fitness levels based on provided features.
- **Regression**: To predict the probability of mental diseases over time.
- **Evaluation**: Assess the performance of different models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
